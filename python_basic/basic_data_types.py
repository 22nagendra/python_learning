"""this program of python is to demonstrate the basic data types in python , 
also teaches how to create variables and assign values to them.
It also shows how to check the type of a variable and print its value.
and how to print the values of variables using the print function.
It is a good practice to use descriptive names for variables to make the code more readable and maintainable.
This program is a basic introduction to Python programming and covers some fundamental concepts of Python."""
#data type is integer,float and operation arthmatic operation

# This is a basic introduction to Python programming.
# var1 = 3
# var2=2
# result = var1*var2
# print(var2,var1, result, sep="\n")
# here is input function in python 
x = float(input("enter your int value")) #int, float  
y = float(input("enter your int value"))
result = x+y
