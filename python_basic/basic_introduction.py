# This is a basic introduction to Python programming.
# Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used for various applications.  
# It is known for its readability and simplicity, making it a great choice for beginners.
# In this file, we will cover some fundamental concepts of Python.

# date type , variables, and basic operations
# In Python, you can create variables to store data.
# Variables can hold different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
# Here are some examples of variable declarations:
# Integer: a whole number   
# Float: a number with a decimal point`
## String: a sequence of characters
# Boolean: a value that can be either True or False 
# # Let's create some variables and assign values to them.
# Memory is allocated for variables when they are created, and they can be used later in the code.
# Variables can be named using letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number.
# It is a good practice to use descriptive names for variables to make the code more readable
# and maintainable.

# Here are some examples of variable declarations:      
# data types in python , int64, float64, string, boolean
# Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
# Each data type has its own characteristics and uses.
# Here are some examples of variable declarations:
# Integer: a whole number       
x = 5  # an integer
y = 3.14  # a float
name = "Alice"  # a string
is_active = True  # a boolean   
# You can print the values of these variables using the print function.


#type of the variable can be checked using the type function`   
# You can check the type of a variable using the type function.
print(type(x),"output is ",x)  # prints <class 'int'>
print(type(y),"output is ",y)  # prints <class 'float'>
print(type(name),"output is ",name) # prints <class 'str'>  
print(type(is_active),"output is ",is_active)
